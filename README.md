# C-Programming--Dice-Roll

The code is included in the report.

Project Overview:
This program simulates the rolling of dice, providing insights into probability and randomness, which are crucial concepts in various fields.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

1. Simulates rolling dice with user-defined faces and throws
2. Calculates and displays the percentage of each face appearing
3. Validates user inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges
4. Dynamically allocates memory for efficient storage of random numbers

ðŸ”§ Technical Details:

1. C Programming: Developed using the C programming language
2. Libraries: Utilized stdio.h for input/output, stdlib.h for random number generation and memory allocation, and time.h for seeding the random function with the current time
3. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Employed malloc to handle variable storage needs
4. Input Validation: Ensured robust input handling to maintain program stability
